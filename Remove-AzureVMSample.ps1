.SYNOPSIS 
    Removes a Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure, deletes attached VHD(s) too.
    Runbook waits untill VM is removed.

.DESCRIPTION
    This runbook removes a VM on Azure
    The Connect-Azure runbook needs to be imported and published before this runbook can be sucessfully run. Steven Henderson
       
.PARAMETER AzureConnectionName
    Name of the Azure connection asset that was created in the Automation service.
    This connection asset contains the subscription id and the name of the certificate asset that 
    holds the management certificate for this subscription.
    
.PARAMETER ServiceName
    Name of the cloud service which VM will belong to. A new cloud service will be created if cloud service by name ServiceName does not exists

.PARAMETER VMName    
    Name of the virtual machine. 

.EXAMPLE
    1) Create Certificate Asset "myCert":
     Use the certificate file (.pfx or .cer file) to create a Certificate asset for ex. "myCred" in 
     Azure -> Automation -> select automation account "MyAutomationAccount" -> Assets -> Add Setting -> Add Credential -> 
     Certificate -> Provide name "myCred" and upload the certificate file (.pfx or .cer)
     
     The same certificate must be associated with the subscription, You can verify the same for your subscription 
     at Azure -> Settings -> Management Certificates


 2) Create Azure Connection Asset "AzureConnection"
     Azure -> Automation -> select automation account "MyAutomationAccount" -> Assets -> Add Setting 
     -> Add Connection -> Select 'Azure' from dropdown -> Provide name ex. "AzureConnection"  ->
     Provide AutomationCertificateName "myCert" you created in step 1 and subscription Id
     
 3) To run runbook: Test or Start the runbook from Author tab
   
   to call from another runbook, ex:
Remove-AzureVMSample -AzureConnectionName "AzureConnection" -ServiceName "myService" -VMName "myVM"
